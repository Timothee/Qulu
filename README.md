Qulu
====

Qulu is a Chrome extension that brings your Hulu queue to your toolbar.

It adds a toolbar button with a badge showing how many videos are in your queue. The popup will list all your videos (up to 25 at a time) and you'll be able to delete them from there or start watching.

It's available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/qulu-%E2%80%93-your-hulu-queue/iggfkakbafpkgjaocfjaoehcclhcjckb).
